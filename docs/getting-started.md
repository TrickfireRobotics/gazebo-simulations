title: Simulations
description: Clone the repository and pick your simulation environment.
---

This repository contains robot simulations for TrickFire Robotics. It provides two complementary environments: [**Gazebo Harmonic**](https://gazebosim.org/docs/harmonic/install/) (with [ROS 2 Jazzy](https://docs.ros.org/en/jazzy/index.html)) for simulating robot subsystems and joint control, and [**Project Chrono**](https://projectchrono.org/) for high-fidelity terrain and wheel-soil physics. Both are driven by a unified Python `sim` CLI that handles building and launching.

## Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/TrickfireRobotics/simulations.git
cd simulations
```
